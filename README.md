# AI’s Involvement in Mental Health

## Overview and Origin

* LIMBIC AI

* Incorporated in 2018 in the United Kingdom.

* Founders are Dr. Ross Harper and Sebastiaan De Vries.

* Ross and Sebastiaan both went to school in the UK and graduated from “Entrepreneur First,” in 2018. In the same year, they started Limbic AI because they wanted to help address the mental health crisis globally.

* Limbic has received most of its funding from venture capitalist. The company currently has support from 16 investors and recently raised a $14M in Series A round backed by Khosla Ventures. Limbic is a private company and its total amount of funding has not been released to the public.

## Business Activities

* This company provides an Artificial Intelligent Chat system for Mental Healthcare Providers that collects information for medical treatment. Limbic specifically created an AI system that is capable of processing administrative responsibility required in an assessment. At the same time, their system will increase health assessment efficiency, decrease administration time, enhance Doctor’s clinical focus, and improve the patient referral experience holistically.

* Limbic AI intended customers are Mental Health Providers. Globally the market size in 2020 was $383.31B and is expected to reach $537.97B by 2030. The market share in the US in 2022 was at $79.99B and is expected to reach $83.70B in 2023. (4.7% Increase)

* Limbic AI has set out and targeted the mental health crisis because it’s a global issue and is making it their mission to expand access to mental health care. This is a huge advantage because Limbic AI has only one competitor outside of the United Kingdom that has a similar AI Chat system located in the United States. The majority of companies within this industry focus on providing AI-Enabled Tools for collecting information to increase productivity and efficiency for multiple industries versus specifically focusing on one industry like Limbic AI (UK) and Woebot Health (US).

 >In a acrticle in the Wall Street Journal, Mona Stylianou, the pricipal clinical lead at Every Mental Health, a nonprofit that provides care to patients through the NHS, says the tool has improved patient access to care by offering a 24/7 self-referral process and a personalized wat to assess patients' needs. They also provide Limbic Care; a Generative AI care companion and Limbic Access; a clinical assessment assistant for patients.

## Landscape

* Limbic AI is in the field of creating AI-Enhanced Information Collection Tools for Mental Health Providers.

* Machine Learning has been around since the 1950s. In 1961, a robotic arm used in factories called, the “Unimate” was created and, in 1964 a communication-based chatbot by the name of “Eliza” was created. It wasn’t until the mid-20th century that AI surged due to the advancements in machine learning and the development of more advanced algorithms. These advancements allowed crucial breakthroughs, which improved available resources and datasets. The current momentum AI has received will continue to drive further development of algorithms that will revolutionize deep learning techniques, like language processing and image recognition in the next 5 - 10 years.

* Currently, Limbic AI has only one major competitor in the Mental Health arena by the name of Woebot Health, incorporated in 2017. Other companies that create AI-Enhanced Information Collection Tools for multiple industries include Clickworker, Aspen, Prolific, Amazon Mechanical Turk, Summa Lingua Technologies, LXT, Toloka AI, Innodata Inc., and DataForce by Transperfect to name a few. Woebot Health is an US based company that targets mental health providers and has raised over $120M, receiving $90M on, 7/21/21. Compared to a traditional clinical setting, this company primarily focuses on getting patients support faster, increasing engagement, and preventive care behaviors for Medicare Advantage Members. They also specialize in products specific to certain populations: Anxiety and depression, Adolescents, Maternal Health, and Adults 65+.

## Results

* Limbic AI has made a huge impact in the mental health industry. The NHS Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) awarded Limbic AI with the first Class Ella UKCA medical device status. The company received the award due to Limbic AI chatbot’s clinical effectiveness, safety, and risk management. In just over a year data is reflecting a 21.5% increase in the use of their services.

* The company measures its success by the amount of time that is saved in every assessment, fewer changes in treatment pathway, and patient approval rate. Currently, Limbic has a 98.7% patient approval rate, 45% fewer changes in treatment pathway, and 25% of time saved in every assessment.

* After carefully evaluating the two companies Limbic’s AI out-performs its competitor Woebot Health because they’ve won an accolade recently in the UK andN is the first company that specifically focuses on mental health with a footprint in two countries. As mentioned in the business activities section, Limbic AI has captured over 280,000 patients and is currently used by over 40% of NHS Mental Health Clinics in the United Kingdom and has recently entered into the US market and should have a positive impact on the mental health crisis currently effecting the US today.

## Recommendations

* One recommendation that could be made to Limbic AI that can add to overall patient satisfaction is a virtual assistant that looks and feels somewhat like a human interaction. The virtual assistant will act in the same capacity as the chatbot, but in a virtual setting giving patients who prefer a visual setting that option.

* An AI virtual assistant human replica will benefit and add value to Limbic AI because it will give patients more than one option on how they interact with AI during the intake of the initial medical assessment. This type of AI innovation from a technology standpoint will provide Limbic AI an opportunity to be the first to create a human-like virtual assistant replica in the mental health industry. This can be an advantage from a business standpoint because it will give them a competitive advantage over competition as they begin to establish their footprint in the US. From a medical standpoint, a virtual assistant will add value to overall client satisfaction by giving more interaction options. This will lead to higher client satisfaction and can increase medical assessment accuracy.

* The AI virtual assistant human replica is beneficial for Limbic AI because it will give patients a choice to choose a preferred method for interacting with their AI-Enhanced Information Collection Tool that is responsible for the intake of the initial medical assessment. This will allow doctors to focus more on clinical care and less on the administrative aspect of the medical assessment.

* The type of technology that this service will utilize is a device that has camera visual capability and audio connection that can transmit both incoming and outgoing audio feed.

* Camera visual and full audio capability allows the patient the ability to have a more personal interaction with the AI virtual assistant human replica. It also provides Limbic AI an opportunity to then study other ways to provide solutions as technology advances enabling the AI virtual assistant human replica to increase its efficiency leading to a higher success rate in referrals made to mental health patients taking the medical assessment.
